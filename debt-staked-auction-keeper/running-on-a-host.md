# Running on a Host

## Prerequisites

Python 3.6+

### Get RAI

Buy RAI from Uniswap v2 or [open a SAFE](https://app.gitbook.com/@reflexer-labs/s/geb/pyflex/safe-management/opening-a-safe) and generate it.

### Clone

```
git clone https://github.com/reflexer-labs/auction-keeper.git
cd auction-keeper
git submodule update --init --recursive
```

### Install

This creates a virtual environment and installs all the keeper dependencies:

`./install.sh`

## 1) Start virtualenv

`source _virtualenv/bin/activate`

## 2) Modify model file as needed

A basic debt stakedauction bidding model can be found in `models/debt_staked_model.py`. This model retrieves the latest FLX/USD price from coingecko and will automatically place bids in an auction.

You probably want to modify the following variables in `models/debt_staked_model.py`:

* `MAXIMUM_FLX_MULTIPLIER`: the maximum acceptable FLX price to use when bidding. Default: `0.90` meaning the maximum price to pay when biding for FLX (with RAI) is 90% of the current FLX/USD market price from Coingecko
* `MINIMUM_FLX_MULTIPLIER`: the minimumum FLX price to use when bidding. This will determine your opening bid.Default: `0.50` meaning the minimumm price to pay when biding for FLX (with RAI) is 50% of the current FLX/USD market price from Coingecko
* `MY_BID_INCREASE`: the bid increase (in RAI) to propose when outbidding another bidder. If the value is smaller than the debt staked auction house's `bidIncrease`, then it will use the value set in the debt staked auction house. Example: a value of `1.10` will use bid increases of 10%. Note: the current `bidIncrease` on mainnet is `1.05`

### Then:

`chmod +x debt_staked_model.py`

For more information about bidding models, see [Bidding Models](../bidding-models.md)

## 3) Modify keeper run file

Modify the following variables in `run_debt_keeper_host.sh`

`KEEPER_ADDRESS` - the keeper's address. It should be in checksummed format (not lowercase)

`ETH_RPC_URL` - the URL of your Ethereum RPC connection

`KEYSTORE_DIR` - the full path of the directory where your keystore file is

`MODEL_DIR` - the full path of directory where your `debt_model.py` file is


`KEYSTORE_FILE` - your Ethereum UTC JSON keystore filename

For more information about this keystore format and how to generate them, check:

* [Ethereum UTC / JSON Wallet Encryption](https://wizardforcel.gitbooks.io/practical-cryptography-for-developers-book/content/symmetric-key-ciphers/ethereum-wallet-encryption.html)
* [keythereum](https://github.com/ethereumjs/keythereum)

`GAS_MAXIMUM` -maximum gas price, in GWEI

### Then:

`chmod +x run_debt_staked_keeper_host.sh`

## 4) Start the keeper and enter your keystore file password

`./run_debt_staked_keeper_host.sh`

```
$ ./run_debt_staked_keeper_host.sh
Password for /keystore/key.json:
```
